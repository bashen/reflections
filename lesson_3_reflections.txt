When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Two places are better than one :).

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You may need multiple local commits before a feature is ready for others to use in the remote repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Clones are copies of an entire Git repository.  Forks are non-local clones made in a hosted environment like GitHub.  Branches are used to do non-linear development within a repository (working on a bug fix while working on a new feature in a separate branch).

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

To know if the remote and local copy are in sync without having to query the remote.
