How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It highlighted only the differences between the two files.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

Can easily go back to old version to check when a bug was introduced.  Can easily see exact changes made with each version.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

More logical, less arbitrary.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Code files have logical links to each other.  One logical change may affect multiple files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log shows every changeset.  git diff shows differences between two changesets.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

You can always revert changes and go back.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
